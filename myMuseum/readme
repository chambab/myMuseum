""" The myMuseum is a place to communicate with others leaving a message,
uploading the pictures to be remembered for a while.


Now working on describing how the image can be deployed.

1. context
It's automatically decided to myMuseum, but supposed to change it to ROOT
'cause of being no consideration of context

2.Should consider which solution you use such as oracle, postgresql, mysql(not supported)
 - Change the function SYSDATE in Oracle to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in postgresql

#fileupload location
# WebRoot/WEB-INF/classes/context.properties


# verification
/WEB-INF/config/ibatis/sql-map-config.xml
/res/imgmgt/mapping-/mapping_ based on spring/applicationContext-query.xml

# clear classes before compiling the java
# ant -f ./build_myMuseum.xml build.here

2. Dockerize
jar -cvf myMuseum.war ./myMuseum/*

docker build -t chambab/mymuseum -f ./dockerfile .

docker run -d -it --name="mymuseum" -p 80:8080 chambab/myMuseum:latest
